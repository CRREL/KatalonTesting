            User acknowledges they are requesting access to For Official Use Only (FOUO) data, which requires a proper need to know and, for authorized Contractors and partners, need to have their request to access this data verified by their US Government point of contact (GPOC). User agrees they have a valid need for such access in connection with the accomplishment of a lawful and authorized Government purpose. The final responsibility for determining whether an individual has a valid need for access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has authorized possession, knowledge, or control of the information, not with the prospective recipient. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DoD Components and between officials of DoD Components and DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees to conduct official business for the Department of Defense, provided that dissemination is consistent with any further controls imposed by a distribution statement. FOUO data must be stored on computer systems that are safeguarded using DoD-approved access controls, encryption, and protection methods and not processed on, or transmitted via, unencrypted or unsecured systems accessible by the public, such as the internet except via approved PKI (public key infrastructure) methods.  Users are specifically prohibited from releasing FOUO data without permission. I agree that I have a valid need for such access in connection with the accomplishment of a lawful and authorized military, defense and/or intelligence purpose.

Please see DoD Manual (DoDM) 5200.01-V4, February 24, 2012, Enclosure 3 for more information.
